	<p>The mantis shrimp's punch is strong enough to crack glass - they actually have to be housed in cages made of polycarbonate sheets. The more common name of polycarbonate is bulletproof glass. The impact of one of their punches is strong enough to generate a spark of electricity with a voltage similar to that of lightning. Not only that, by their "paw" - more like a cudgel - moves so quickly that it actually leaves a void in the water. This void is basically a vacuum that causes the water around it to rush in so quickly that the impact of water colliding on itself releases enough energy to generate light on the order of a flashbulb.</p>

	<p>The mantis shrimp lives in deeper waters - where light is at a premium. Because of this, it has extremely light sensitive eyes. In addition to having low-light vision, they can see in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectra. The collest thing though is that their eyes have several more rods than human eyes - meaning they can see more colors in the visible spectra than we can!</p>
